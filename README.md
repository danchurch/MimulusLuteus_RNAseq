# MimulusLuteus_RNAseq

This is a repo for the RNA work I will be doing to examine the effects of our RNAi transformations of Mimulus luteus var. variegatus. RNAi silencing was used to induce changes in petal coloration - wild type petals show pink phenotype, and transformed plants show a mostly white phenotype. This hypothesized to be from successful silencing of the myb5a gene, a  transcription factor in the petal anthocyanin pathway, as shown by the research of Cooley et al.
