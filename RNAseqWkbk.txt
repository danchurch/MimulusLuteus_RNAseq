## let's get started on the RNA seq pipeline for Mlv

## we want to see what the effects of our RNAi silencing 
## were in our plants. 

## siRNA silencing works by silencing targeting mRNA after 
## it leaves the nuclease. So it has been processed into 
## mature RNA etc. 

## I'm not sure how fast acting RNAi is, but we can assume
## that in order to have phenotypic effects it is pretty 
## rapid, and that we see a lower amount of myb5a transcripts
## floating around from RNAi-transformed petals. 

## I do not know how persistent the fragments from RNAi 
## are, they may come into play here, but I presume the 
## the RNAses kick in pretty kick...

## anyway, our most immediate hypothesis is that we will
## see relatively less abundance of myb5a present in this 
## petal tissue. We can then hypothesize that this will
## cascade to lower expression of down stream genes in 
## the petal anthocyanin pathway. 

## more reading is to be done, I'm just not familiar with 
## what we think the mimulus petal anthocyanin pathways. 
## but what we can start to do now is look at our read 
## qualities. 

## to start off, we need to do some quality control, maybe
## trim some BPs, drop off the low quality stuff. 
## fairly familiar territory. 

## Josh's friend Ron still uses fastx for this, I wonder if
## we have another route, I remember fastx having issues 
## with plotting newer illumina read sets...

## let's get all fasta files unzipped and into a useful place:

## we'll put them here on the lab mac:
fastaFolder="/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/Mlv_raw_unzipped"

## go to our gz files:

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MlvMnaRNA_raw_compressed

for i in *gz; do
gunzip < $i > $fastaFolder/${i%.gz}
done


## we'll try to do this in the HTseq python package, following
## the examples in their tutorials

## https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.10.0/tour.html#reading-in-reads

python3

import HTSeq, os, itertools

import biopython as bio

import matplotlib as plt
import numpy as np

## let's read in our reads:

fastaFolder="/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/Mlv_raw_unzipped"
os.chdir(fastaFolder)
fastqFile=os.listdir()[0]

fastq = HTSeq.FastqReader(fastqFile)

for read in itertools.islice(fastq, 10):
    print(read)

## to get average quality at each site:

## make an array as long as the number of bps in our reads:

qualsum = np.zeros( len(read), np.int)
nreads = 0
for read in fastq:
    qualsum += read.qual
    nreads += 1

qualsum / nreads = avgQuals

## etc. But what we want for tonight is a actually 
## a htseq script used from the command line:

#! /usr/bin/env bash

fastaFolder="/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/Mlv_raw_unzipped"
wd="/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MimulusLuteus_RNAseq"

cd $fastaFolder

for i in *; do
    echo ${i%fastq}_qa.pdf
    htseq-qa -t fastq --nosplit --outfile ${i%fastq}_qa.pdf $i
done


## worked - get those into our repo? 

## confusing, cause we're working remotely in a git repo but 
## were in one locally, and there is a version of this log in 
## both. 

## so keep things separate, I guess. All file updates besides this 
## log will be from the labcomp and all workbook updates from my 
## laptop.

## anyway... 

## check our reads for primers/barcodes?

## for sample S1, our barcodes are GTAACTTGGT+AGACTGCGAA

grep GTAACTTGGT $fastaFolder/4956_S1_S26_L005_R1_001.fastq 
grep AGACTGCGAA $fastaFolder/4956_S1_S26_L005_R1_001.fastq 

## reverse complements
grep ACCAAGTTAC $fastaFolder/4956_S1_S26_L005_R1_001.fastq ## common, but not at the ends..
grep TTCGCAGTCT $fastaFolder/4956_S1_S26_L005_R1_001.fastq ## also common, but not at the ends..

## I think we're clear on that. 

## Reads look good. Except the beginnings BPs are lower quality. 
## but not so bad that we need to trim, I guess. 

## I guess we can take a second look after alignment.

## let's play with hisat2:

curl -O "ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/hisat2/downloads/hisat2-2.1.0-OSX_x86_64.zip"

## side note: using aspera to upload to SRA:

ascp -i /Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/aspera.openssh -QT -l100m -k1 -d /Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MlvMnaRNA_raw_compressed/ subasp@upload.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:uploads/danchurchthomas@gmail.com_NoZoYQba

ls -l /Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/aspera.openssh


## okay, so now what? How can we check the alignments?

grep "@SQ" 4956_S6_S31_L005_R1_001.sam | wc -l
## don't do that. but SQ should indicate our scaffolds

## how do we find the unaligned reads?

## sams live here:
samDir='/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MimulusLuteus_RNAseq/SAMs'
bamDir='/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MimulusLuteus_RNAseq/BAMs'

## go to BAM, sorting as we go

cd $samDir

for i in *; do
    echo $i "   " ${i/\.sam/_sorted\.bam}
    samtools sort -O bam -T "$file" -o $bamDir/${i/\.sam/_sorted\.bam} $i
done

## Works...

## how do we find the level of reads aligned vs. non?

samtools view -f u 4956_S1_S26_L005_R1_001_sorted.bam > notMappedS1.sam

## interesting. but moving on, we have a gff file from coge. Can we use this
## to get counts for our transcripts/genes?

## Ron's final step is to use HTSeq to generate count data:

htseq-count -f bam -i gene_id -t gene -s no "$file" $GFF > "$outfile" 

## I have a lot of questions here, but let's try to get something like this
## running before I dig into the lit a little deeper to answer my questions,
## because this might take some time:


## bam directory is:
bamDir=/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MimulusLuteus_RNAseq/BAMs
## our gff file from CoGe is symlinked here:
GFF=/Users/danthomas/Documents/RNAi_Mvar_RNAseq/MimulusLuteus_RNAseq/lutRefGenome/Mimulus_luteus_complete_w_single_exons_standard_renamed_genes.gff

cd $bamDir

for i in  $bamDir/*; do 
    echo $i "   " ${i/sorted\.bam/HTSeqCounts.txt} 
    htseq-count -f bam -t exon -i Parent -s no $i $GFF \
            > ${i/sorted\.bam/HTSeqCounts.txt} 
done

## let's try one:






htseq-count --help
